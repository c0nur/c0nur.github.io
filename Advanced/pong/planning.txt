Pong: A simple game about bouncing a ball similar to tennis.
    When the ball goes off screen it will create a point to a person on the opposite end of the screen
    each person controls a rectangle when touching the ball it will bounce it off the rectangle.
Goals: At the start the ball is in the center of the screen and paddles are in the middle and each player controls a paddle
    The Players can move the paddle up and down as long as it stays on the screen the ball will move at a randomn direction on start
    The goal is to score as many points as possible so when a ball goes off screen on the left or right it counts as a point to the adjacent player
End: The game will not end it would go on until one player quits I could put a score cap but that seems like it wouldn't be fun
The If statements included will be:
If the ball hits the paddles the x and y axis are reversed and momentum is kept OR increased by a set number
If the ball hits the top or bottom of the screen then the Y axis is reversed
If the pall goes off screen on player 1s side then player two scores and vise versa
The board, scoring system and any user interface will be static
The ball and Paddles will be animated
Events: events occuring in this will be a click or press to start and then arrow keys and WASD controll the paddles
The first event to start the game will execute a function to begin updating and the keypresses to control the paddles will affect the Y axis movement without any momentum so letting off the key completely stops the movement
For example on the press of the UP arrow key
    1) The moment of the Y axis is set to a positive number
    2) the paddle is animated to move upwards with a hitbox that will allow the ball to bounce
